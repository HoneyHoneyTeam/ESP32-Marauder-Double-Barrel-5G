## What is ESP32 Marauder - Double Barrel 5G? 
First of all, what is the [ESP32 Marauder Double Barrel](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP32-Marauder-Double-Barrel)? 

"Double Barrel" refers to the fact that the device runs two sperated Marauders simultaneously. The first Marauder features a 2.8-inch screen, an onboard 800mAh battery, GPS, and a microSD card slot. The second Marauder is connected to and controlled by the Flipper Zero.

Due to limitations of the this particular ESP32 chipset, the Marauder currently supports only 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. However, recent developments with the BW16 Kit / RTL8720DN chipset have shown promising results to 5GHz Wifi. This is exactly what we have implenmented on the 5G cousin of the Double Barrel. 

<br/>

## Pre-flight Check / Settings Before First Use 

> [!NOTE]
> All our products are thoroughly checked and configured prior to shipping. While most of our products are plug-and-play, a few specific settings need to be adjusted on your Flipper Zero to ensure proper communication with the Double Barrel 5G.

<br/>

### SubGhz <433mhz>
- **No initial setup is required for SubGhz chipset detection**. The Flipper Zero automatically recognizes an external SubGhz chipset when it connect to The Double Barrel 5G. 
- To confirm if the Flipper Zero is using the external SubGhz chipset, or to switch to it manually:
	1. On your Flipper Zero, navigate to the main menu.
	2. Go to: **Sub-Ghz** -> **Radio Settings** -> **Module**.
	3. Select **External**."
- The SubGhz part of the Double Barrel is fully functional even the first marauder is in OFF mode


<br/>

### 1st Set Marauder / Standalone section (The one with 2.8inch Touch Screen)

- No initial setup is required
- Turn ON or OFF via the switch located on the right side of the Double Barrel / (labeled <**D**>)
- If you would like to update the firmware, please remeber to download **V6 version** of the firmware BIN file

<br/>

### The BW16 part

- The BW16 part use UART 15 and 16 for communicating with Flipper, hence it is necessary to switch from the default 13 & 14 GPIO to 15 & 16.
	1. On your Flipper Zero, navigate to the main menu.
	2. Go to: **Momentum** -> **Protocols** -> **GPIO Pins** -> **ESP32/8266 UART**.
	3. Select **Extra 15, 16**.

- Then, The FAP file need to copy into Flipper SD card, as showed in the following. 
	1. Download the FAP file from [here](Assets/5G.fap) (Right Click and Save AS)
 	2. Copy the file into <**you SD card/Apps/GPIO**> directory. You could do so via a Micro SD card reader, or via qFlipper App. 
  	3. Put the SD card back into Flipper, and you should be able to find an APP call **5G wifi Deauth** in through Flipper manual **APPS** -> **GPIO** -> **5G wifi deauth**
  	   
<br/>

### GPS

- To use the GPS function of Double Barrel 5G via the Flipper Zero, please see the steps below.
  	1. Set the **bottom switch** on the left side of the Double Barrel 5G (labeled <**C**>) to the **DOWN** position.
		- UP position: GPS is powered by the Double Barrel's onboard 800mAh battery.
  		- DOWN position: GPS is powered by the Flipper Zero's battery.
  	2. On your Flipper Zero, navigate to the main menu.
	3. Go to: **Momentum** -> **Protocols** -> **GPIO Pins** -> **NWEA GPS UART**.
	4. Select **Default 13, 14**."
	5. For testing purpose, Go to **Apps** -> **GPIO** -> **[NMEA]GPS**.
	6. Acquiring a GPS signal might take up to a minute. The exact time depends on your location and how open or obstructed the sky is.

### 1st Set Marauder (The one with 2.8inch Touch Screen)

1. Take the Micro SD card from the Double Barrel and connect to an PC / Laptop / Mac / whatever

2. Download the **V6** firmware file, which is usual inclued < **_new_hardware.bin/_v6.bin** > in the name, from [Marauder website](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases).
   
3. **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE double check which version of Marauder you have downladed and used. 
   
4. When you have checked the bin file, copy the file to the Micro SD card and rename it as< **update.bin** >. Then, insert the Micro SD card back into the Marauder Unit.

5. Please double-check that you have downloaded the correct file and verify its size to ensure it wasn't corrupted during the download process. Using the wrong or a corrupted firmware file may brick the device. If that happen, pleases check [this tutorial of how to revive / recovery the device](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP-Programmer-for-Slim-Jim-Double-Barrel-Double-Barrel-5G). 
   
6. Turn on the Marauder Unit, Navigating menu as following: < **Device** > => < **Update firmware** > => < **SD Update** > => < **Yes** >. In rare cases, Marauder may repeatedly show that the firmware file is corrupted and exit the update process shortly, no matter how many times you try. We suggest using a new microSD card in such cases.
   
7. In a minute, The unit should restart itself and you are golden.

## How to switch firmware for the standalone section, such as from Marauder to Bruce, or vice versa
<details>
<summary> Click the Triangle for more details</summary>


**Notes: Based on our testing (18.June.2025), Bruce firmware can be load into the standalone section of Double Barrel / Double Barrel 5G. but it is still a bit buggy, and not 100% of Bruce funcationality is fully supported, which is understandable**

1. [An ESP32 programmer](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP-Programmer-for-Slim-Jim-Double-Barrel-Double-Barrel-5G) is included in the package. Connecting the programmer to the GPIO port located in the lower-right corner of the device, as shown in the following picture.

![Alt text](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP-Programmer-for-Slim-Jim-Double-Barrel-Double-Barrel-5G/blob/main/Assets/images/GPIO.Double.jpg)

2. Using Google Chrome, go to [Bruce.Computer website](https://bruce.computer/flasher). At the bottom of the page, select '**Latest Release**' -> '**Custom Boards**' -> '**Marauder V4 or V6**' -> '**Install**'
   
3. After that, while **holding down the boot button** (Marked as 2) on the back of the device using a pin or the metal stylus included with the Double Barrel, **connect** the ESP32 programmer to your PC's USB port. This will put the device into bootloader/download mode, as shown in the following picture.

![Alt text](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP-Programmer-for-Slim-Jim-Double-Barrel-Double-Barrel-5G/raw/main/Assets/images/bootDouble.jpg)
   
4. If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to select the COM port from the prompt window on the Bruce website. The website will handle the rest of the process automatically.
   
5. After about a minute, the website should indicate that the process is complete. You can then disconnect the deviceâ€”now it's time to explore!

## How to upgrade BW16 firmware 
<details>

1. When we shipped out the Double Barrel 5G, the BW16 was pre-loaded with one of the 5G firmware versions. This firmware is compatible with the FAP call [5G WiFi deauth](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/ESP32-Marauder-Double-Barrel-5G/blob/main/Assets/5G.fap).

2. Regarding the effectiveness and functionality of the BW16 kit on 5G WiFi networks: it works and is quite effective. However, its functionality is limited to scanning and deauthentication. There may be other binaries or firmware options available, such as Evil Portal or CLI support, but due to time constraints and limited manpower, we haven't been able to test them all. That said, we believe the open-source community will likely develop additional tools, as around 90% of the code is compatible and reuseable.

3. If you would like to explore more on the 5G side of the business, you could load BW16 with [delfyrtl firmware and its compatiable flipper APP](https://github.com/gorebrau/delfyRTL) 

4. **The Delfyrtl GitHub page has a clear description of how to load the firmware, but we will be updating our own version of the loading procedure soon. Please check back in a few days for the latest instructions.  - 19.06.2025 by Anson**

## Warrenty and Tech Support

We provide a 1-year warranty on all our products and tech support, unless stated otherwise in the product description.

FYI, our [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/HoneyHoneyTrading) shop is no longer in operation. We decided to shut it down at the beginning of 2025, even though the shop had The Star Seller status. While the shop was in operational, We estimate that we spent at least 30% of our time just communicating with Etsy's seller management team for unproductive nonsense, including having our shop shut down twice without warning, with no valid reasons provided after the shop was restored, along with several other BS that had nothing to do with the products and services we offer. 

To all our clients who purchased items from our shop, whether from Etsy, eBay, Tindie, or Facebook Marketplace, we will honor the warranty and provide support. Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com. or [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/61452559581)
